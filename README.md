## A simple fanmade UI rework of Fallout FM
I made it because I don't like the base UI of their app but love the concept.
##  Technical details
It's hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and I use a <em>_redirects</em> conf file with it for bypassing Https call (the original station uses simple Http).
I used a modified version of [fatNav](https://github.com/Glitchbone/jquery-fatNav) for [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) on some menus.
#### Thanks to [Radio Fallout.FM](http://www.fallout.fm/)
Amazing concept, this project is based on theirs.
I just streamed on their [Icecast2](http://fallout.fm:8000/) server, make my own code for desktop, tab and mobile ([PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app)), and changed the entire UI/design.
