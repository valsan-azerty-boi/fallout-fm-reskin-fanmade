## A simple fanmade reskin and rework of Fallout FM
I made it because I don't like the base css of their app but love the concept.
## It's a work in progress
Be patient it's a wip.
It's hosted on Netlify and I use a _redirects conf file with it for bypassing Https call (the original station uses simple Http).
#### Thanks to [Radio Fallout.FM](http://www.fallout.fm/)
The project is based on theirs.
I just streamed on their Icecast2 station, simplified code for desktop and pwa, and changed the whole design.
