## A simple fanmade reskin and rework of Fallout FM
I made it because I don't like the base ui of their app but love the concept.
##  Technical details (It's a work in progress)
It's hosted on Netlify and I use a _redirects conf file with it for bypassing Https call (the original station uses simple Http).
I used a modified version of [fatNav](https://github.com/Glitchbone/jquery-fatNav) for jQuery on some menus.
#### Thanks to [Radio Fallout.FM](http://www.fallout.fm/)
The project is based on theirs.
I just streamed on their Icecast2 station, make my own code for desktop and mobile (pwa), and changed the whole design.
